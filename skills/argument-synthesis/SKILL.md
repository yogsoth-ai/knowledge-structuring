# Argument Synthesis

Synthesize coherent positions from the argument graph. Aggregates evidence across claims, resolves contradictions where possible, and produces synthesis reports that identify which claims survive scrutiny and which are undermined.

## Budget Slice

| Metric | Small | Medium | Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Claims synthesized | 10 | 25 | 50 |
| Contradictions resolved | 2 | 6 | 12 |
| Synthesis reports | 1 | 3 | 5 |

## State Ledger

<HARD-GATE>
Print before every iteration:

| Metric | Target | Current | % |
|--------|--------|---------|---|
| Claims synthesized | — | — | — |
| Contradictions resolved | — | — | — |
| Synthesis reports | — | — | — |
</HARD-GATE>

## Budget Gate

Cannot exit until 80% of budget targets met.

## Adversarial Completeness Probe

After budget gate passes, self-check:
- Does the synthesis address all major contradictions?
- Are surviving claims genuinely supported or just uncontested?
- Does the report acknowledge remaining uncertainty?

Max 2 extra iterations if gaps found.

## Tactics Available

- **claim-decomposition** — decompose complex positions for analysis
- **strength-assessment** — final strength evaluation for synthesis

## SOPs Available

- **argument-visualization** — generate argument structure visualization
- **synthesis-report** — produce the final synthesis document
