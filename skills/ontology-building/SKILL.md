# Ontology Building

Build a structured ontology for a research domain. Extracts concepts from sources, types their relationships, constructs taxonomies, validates consistency, and iteratively refines until the ontology is coherent and complete.

## Manifest

| Level | Count | Skills |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Strategy | 5 | domain-scoping, concept-extraction, relation-typing, taxonomy-validation, ontology-refinement |
| Tactic | 3 | concept-decomposition, hierarchy-construction, consistency-checking |
| SOP | 10 | seed-concept-search, source-gathering, concept-page-creation, alias-resolution, edge-batch-creation, hierarchy-visualization, gap-detection, merge-candidates, confidence-update, ontology-export |

## Budget Table

| Metric | Small | Medium | Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Source pages ingested | 10 | 25 | 50 |
| Concept pages created | 15 | 40 | 80 |
| Edges created | 30 | 100 | 200 |
| Taxonomy depth (levels) | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Validation passes | 1 | 2 | 3 |

## Strategy Sequence (Reference, Not Prescription)

1. **domain-scoping** — define boundaries, identify seed concepts, classify topic size
2. **concept-extraction** — mine sources for concepts, create pages, resolve aliases
3. **relation-typing** — identify and type relationships between concepts
4. **taxonomy-validation** — check hierarchy consistency, detect gaps and conflicts
5. **ontology-refinement** — merge near-duplicates, fill gaps, update confidence scores

CC may reorder, skip, or repeat strategies based on the domain's needs.

## MCP Tools Used

- `vault_search` — find existing concepts, detect duplicates
- `vault_add_edge` — create typed relationships
- `vault_query_graph` — explore concept neighborhoods
- `vault_graph_stats` — assess ontology coverage and connectivity
- `vault_lint` — validate structural integrity
- `vault_index` — maintain search index

## Context-Management

<HARD-GATE>
- Call `context-init` at campaign start
- Call `context-checkpoint` after each strategy completes
- Call `knowledge-compilation` (wiki-vault tactic) after each strategy
</HARD-GATE>

## Guiding Principles

- **Breadth before depth.** Map the concept landscape broadly before drilling into any sub-area.
- **Edges over pages.** A concept without relationships is useless. Prioritize connecting over creating.
- **Aliases are enemies.** The same concept with different names fragments the ontology. Resolve aggressively.
- **Confidence is honest.** Mark uncertain classifications explicitly. Low confidence is better than false certainty.
- **The ontology is never finished.** Each research session may reveal new concepts or invalidate old ones.
