# Intervention Page Creation

Document an intervention: what variable is manipulated, how, and what the predicted/observed effects are.

## Tool

CC file write + `vault_add_edge`

## Protocol

1. Write `claims/<intervention-slug>.md` with frontmatter (type: claim, confidence, tags: [intervention])
2. Body: target variable, manipulation method, predicted effects, observed effects (if available)
3. Add edges: addresses (intervention → question), derived_from (intervention → variable)
4. Link supporting evidence

## HARD-GATE

<HARD-GATE>
Intervention must specify: target variable, direction of manipulation, predicted downstream effects.
</HARD-GATE>

## Yield

Returns: `{ path: string, target_variable: string, predicted_effects: string[] }`
