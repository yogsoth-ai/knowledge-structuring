# Gap Prioritization

Rank the empty cells (unexplored combinations) by their potential value. Not all gaps are worth filling — prioritize by novelty, feasibility, and expected impact.

## Guiding Focus

An empty cell is only an opportunity if it's feasible and valuable. Rank gaps by: (1) how novel the combination is, (2) how feasible it is to realize, (3) what impact it would have if successful.

## Available Tactics

- matrix-generation — refine the matrix with priority annotations
- axis-extraction — verify gap is truly unexplored (not just differently named)

## Budget Slice

| Metric | S | M | L |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Gaps scored | 3 | 8 | 15 |
| Questions generated | 3 | 8 | 15 |
| Top priorities identified | 2 | 4 | 8 |

## State Ledger Template

```
| Metric              | Target | Current | Status |
|---------------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Gaps scored         | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
| Questions generated | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
| Top priorities      | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
```

<HARD-GATE>
Cannot exit until 80% of budget met. Print state ledger before each iteration decision.
