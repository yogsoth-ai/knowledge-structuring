# Combination Mapping

Enumerate combinations across identified dimensions. Mark which cells are occupied (existing work), which are empty (opportunities), and which are impossible (constraints).

## Guiding Focus

The matrix is the map. Populate it systematically — for each combination, determine if existing work covers it, if it's feasible but unexplored, or if it's impossible due to constraints.

## Available Tactics

- matrix-generation — generate and populate the combination matrix
- axis-extraction — refine axes based on what combinations reveal

## Budget Slice

| Metric | S | M | L |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Combinations explored | 8 | 25 | 50 |
| Existing work mapped | 5 | 15 | 30 |
| Empty cells identified | 3 | 10 | 20 |

## State Ledger Template

```
| Metric              | Target | Current | Status |
|---------------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Combinations explored| X     | 0       | ⬜     |
| Existing work mapped| X      | 0       | ⬜     |
| Empty cells found   | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
```

<HARD-GATE>
Cannot exit until 80% of budget met. Print state ledger before each iteration decision.
