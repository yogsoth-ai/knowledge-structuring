# Evidence Weighing

Assess the strength of evidence for causal claims. Not all evidence is equal — RCTs > observational studies > expert opinion > anecdote.

## Available SOPs

- evidence-linking — connect evidence to claims
- confidence-scoring — assign calibrated confidence
- contradiction-flagging — identify conflicting evidence

## Guiding Principles

- **Hierarchy of evidence.** Interventional > observational > theoretical > anecdotal.
- **Effect size matters.** A statistically significant but tiny effect is weak evidence for practical causation.
- **Replication is king.** Single studies are suggestive; replicated findings are convincing.
- **Confounders weaken.** Evidence from studies with uncontrolled confounders gets lower weight.
- **Mechanism strengthens.** Evidence backed by a plausible mechanism gets higher weight.

## Minimum Yield

<HARD-GATE>
