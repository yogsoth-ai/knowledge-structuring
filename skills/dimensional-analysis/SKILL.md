# Dimensional Analysis

Map the design space of a research area by discovering its fundamental dimensions (axes of variation), enumerating meaningful combinations, and identifying unexplored regions that represent novel opportunities.

## Manifest

| Level | Count | Skills |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Strategy | 3 | dimension-discovery, combination-mapping, gap-prioritization |
| Tactic | 2 | axis-extraction, matrix-generation |
| SOP | 6 | dimension-page-creation, axis-validation, combination-enumeration, novelty-scoring, question-generation, matrix-export |

## Budget Table

| Metric | Small | Medium | Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Dimensions identified | 3 | 6 | 10 |
| Axes per dimension | 3 | 5 | 8 |
| Combinations explored | 10 | 30 | 60 |
| Novel gaps identified | 3 | 8 | 15 |
| Questions generated | 5 | 12 | 25 |

## Strategy Sequence (Reference, Not Prescription)

1. **dimension-discovery** — identify fundamental axes of variation in the design space
2. **combination-mapping** — enumerate interesting combinations, mark existing work
3. **gap-prioritization** — rank unexplored combinations by novelty and feasibility

## MCP Tools Used

- `vault_search` — find existing coverage of dimension values
- `vault_add_edge` — connect dimensions to concepts
- `vault_query_graph` — explore existing dimension neighborhoods
- `vault_graph_stats` — assess coverage completeness

## Context-Management

<HARD-GATE>
- Call `context-init` at campaign start
- Call `context-checkpoint` after each strategy completes
- Call `knowledge-compilation` after each strategy
</HARD-GATE>

## Guiding Principles

- **Dimensions are independent.** If two axes always co-vary, they're likely one dimension.
- **Completeness over depth.** Map the full space first, then drill into promising regions.
- **Empty cells are opportunities.** An unexplored combination in a well-populated matrix is a research opportunity.
- **Feasibility constrains.** Not all combinations are realizable. Mark impossible combinations explicitly.
- **Cross-domain dimensions.** The most interesting dimensions often come from outside the domain.
