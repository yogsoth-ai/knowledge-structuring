# Concept Extraction

Mine source pages for concepts. Create concept pages, resolve aliases, ensure every concept is properly named and connected.

## Guiding Focus

Extract concepts systematically from sources. Prefer precision over recall — it's better to have 20 well-defined concepts than 50 vague ones. Resolve naming conflicts immediately.

## Available Tactics

- concept-decomposition — break compound concepts into atomic parts
- consistency-checking — verify extracted concepts don't conflict

## Budget Slice

| Metric | S | M | L |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Sources processed | 8 | 20 | 40 |
| Concepts extracted | 12 | 30 | 60 |
| Aliases resolved | 3 | 10 | 20 |

## State Ledger Template

```
| Metric              | Target | Current | Status |
|---------------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Sources processed   | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
| Concepts extracted  | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
| Aliases resolved    | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
```

<HARD-GATE>
Cannot exit until 80% of budget met. Print state ledger before each iteration decision.
