# Evidence Linking (Argument)

Link evidence to claims with typed relationships. Searches for supporting and contradicting evidence, creates structured edges, assesses evidence quality, and identifies claims lacking sufficient evidential support.

## Budget Slice

| Metric | Small | Medium | Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Evidence links created | 15 | 40 | 80 |
| Claims with evidence | 8 | 20 | 40 |
| Contradictions found | 2 | 6 | 12 |

## State Ledger

<HARD-GATE>
Print before every iteration:

| Metric | Target | Current | % |
|--------|--------|---------|---|
| Evidence links created | — | — | — |
| Claims with evidence | — | — | — |
| Contradictions found | — | — | — |
</HARD-GATE>

## Budget Gate

Cannot exit until 80% of budget targets met.

## Adversarial Completeness Probe

After budget gate passes, self-check:
- Are there claims with only supporting evidence (confirmation bias)?
- Are there high-confidence claims with weak evidence?
- Is evidence diversity sufficient (multiple independent sources)?

Max 2 extra iterations if gaps found.

## Tactics Available

- **strength-assessment** — evaluate the strength of evidence-claim relationships

## SOPs Available

- **evidence-attachment** — attach evidence to a claim with typed edge
- **strength-scoring** — assign strength scores to claims based on evidence
