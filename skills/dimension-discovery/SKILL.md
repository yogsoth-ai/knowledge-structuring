# Dimension Discovery

Identify the fundamental axes of variation that define the design space. Each dimension should be independent and meaningful.

## Guiding Focus

Look for the axes that practitioners implicitly use when comparing approaches. "Fast vs accurate", "local vs global", "supervised vs unsupervised" — these are dimensions. Find the ones specific to your domain.

## Available Tactics

- axis-extraction — systematically extract axes from literature
- matrix-generation — test independence of candidate dimensions

## Budget Slice

| Metric | S | M | L |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Candidate dimensions | 5 | 10 | 15 |
| Validated dimensions | 3 | 6 | 10 |
| Sources analyzed | 8 | 20 | 40 |

## State Ledger Template

```
| Metric              | Target | Current | Status |
|---------------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Candidate dimensions| X      | 0       | ⬜     |
| Validated dimensions| X      | 0       | ⬜     |
| Sources analyzed    | X      | 0       | ⬜     |
```

<HARD-GATE>
Cannot exit until 80% of budget met. Print state ledger before each iteration decision.
