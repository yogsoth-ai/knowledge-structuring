# Axis Extraction

Systematically extract axes of variation from literature. Look for how authors compare methods, what trade-offs they discuss, what design choices they highlight.

## Available SOPs

- dimension-page-creation — create pages for identified dimensions
- axis-validation — verify axes are independent and meaningful
- wiki-search — check for existing dimension coverage

## Guiding Principles

- **Comparison reveals axes.** When authors say "method A is X while method B is Y", X-Y is likely a dimension.
- **Trade-offs are dimensions.** "You can have speed or accuracy" reveals the speed-accuracy dimension.
- **Taxonomies are pre-built axes.** Existing classifications in the field are validated dimensions.
- **Independence test.** If changing one axis always changes another, they're not independent.

## Minimum Yield

<HARD-GATE>
≥2 candidate axes identified per invocation with independence assessment.
