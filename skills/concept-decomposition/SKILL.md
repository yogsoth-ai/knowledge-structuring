# Concept Decomposition

Break compound or over-broad concepts into their atomic constituents. A concept that means too many things should become multiple focused concepts connected by edges.

## Available SOPs

- wiki-search — find existing sub-concepts
- concept-page-creation — create new atomic concept pages
- edge-batch-creation — connect parent to children
- alias-resolution — ensure no naming conflicts

## Guiding Principles

- **Atomic means testable.** If you can't write a one-sentence definition, the concept is too broad.
- **Preserve the parent.** Decomposition creates children; the parent becomes a container (component_of edges).
- **Stop at utility.** Don't decompose below the level where distinctions matter for the research.

## Minimum Yield

<HARD-GATE>
≥2 child concepts created per decomposition invocation.
If a concept cannot be meaningfully decomposed, report it as atomic and exit.
