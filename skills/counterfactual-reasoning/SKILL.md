# Counterfactual Reasoning

Reason about what would happen if a variable were different. "If X had not occurred, would Y still have happened?" This is the gold standard for causal identification.

## Available SOPs

- causal-chain-query — trace causal paths to identify dependencies
- contradiction-flagging — flag when counterfactual contradicts observed evidence
- confidence-scoring — assess confidence in counterfactual conclusions

## Guiding Principles

- **Minimal change.** Counterfactuals should change only the target variable, holding all else constant.
- **Mechanism required.** A counterfactual without a mechanism is speculation, not reasoning.
- **Multiple paths.** If Y can be caused by X through multiple paths, removing X may not remove Y.
- **Temporal ordering.** Causes precede effects. Counterfactuals that violate temporal order are invalid.

## Minimum Yield

<HARD-GATE>
≥1 counterfactual assessment with explicit mechanism and confidence score per invocation.
