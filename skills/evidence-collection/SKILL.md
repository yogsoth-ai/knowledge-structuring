# Evidence Collection

Systematically gather and attach evidence pages to the causal claims in the model, creating supported_by edges for confirming evidence and contradicts edges for disconfirming evidence. A causal model without evidence provenance is speculation; this strategy converts it into a structured, auditable knowledge artifact.

## Guiding Focus

CC should treat evidence collection as adversarial by default: for every supported_by edge added, actively search for contradicting evidence before moving on. The contradicts edges are as important as the supported_by edges — a model that only records confirming evidence is biased. Evidence pages must record the source, study design (where applicable), and a brief assessment of quality. Quantity matters less than coverage across independent sources.

## Available Tactics

- evidence-weighing — score each evidence page by study design strength, sample size, and independence from other sources
- counterfactual-reasoning — use "what evidence would change this claim?" to direct the search toward the most informative gaps
- feedback-loop-detection — flag evidence patterns that suggest bidirectional causation rather than clean one-way support

## Budget Slice

| Metric | S | M | L |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Evidence pages created | 8 | 20 | 45 |
| supported_by edges | 10 | 25 | 50 |
| contradicts edges flagged | 2 | 5 | 10 |
