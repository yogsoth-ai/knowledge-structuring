# Alias Resolution

Detect when two concept pages refer to the same thing under different names. Merge into canonical page.

## Tool

`vault_search` + CC file operations + `vault_add_edge`

## Protocol

1. Search vault for the concept name and common synonyms
2. If multiple pages cover the same concept: choose canonical name
3. Merge content from duplicate into canonical page
4. Redirect all edges from duplicate to canonical
5. Delete duplicate page
6. Update index

## HARD-GATE

<HARD-GATE>
Before merging, verify the pages truly refer to the same concept (not related but distinct concepts).
</HARD-GATE>

## Yield

Returns: `{ merged: boolean, canonical: string, aliases_resolved: string[] }`
